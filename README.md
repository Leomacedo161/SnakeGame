# SnakeGame

## Description
This is a classic Snake Game developed in C++ using the Raylib library. The objective of the game is to control the snake to eat the food and grow as much as possible without colliding with the edges of the screen or its own body.

## Technologies Used
- C++: Programming language used to develop the game.
- Raylib: C++ game library used to create the graphical interface and handle input events.

## How to Run
1. Make sure you have a C++ compiler installed on your system.
2. Download or clone the game repository.
3. Open the SnakeGame.cpp file in a code editor.
4. Compile and run the code using your preferred C++ compiler.
   - Make sure all dependencies (Raylib) are installed correctly.
   - Refer to the Raylib documentation for specific installation instructions.

## How to Play
- Use the arrow keys (up, down, left, right) to control the direction of the snake.
- The goal is to eat the food (represented by a square) to grow.
- Avoid colliding with the edges of the screen or the snake's own body.
- The score is counted by the number of foods eaten.
